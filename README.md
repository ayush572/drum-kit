# drum-kit
###  Made completely using HTML, CSS and JS. 
#### In this project, advanced DOM feactures have been used such as, timeouts, addEventListener, callback functions, recognizing button and mouse clicks. 
#### I have even added sounds to the buttons which when clicked or pressed using keyboard, will play the respective sound of the drumset!
